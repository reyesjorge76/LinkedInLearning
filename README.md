Are you brand-new to coding in JavaScript? Or are you just looking to learn a little bit more? Sometimes, when you learn a new framework, you need to jump right in and get things done. Join LinkedIn Learning senior instructor Morten Rand-Hendriksen as he shows you what it takes to get started writing JavaScript without trying to familiarize yourself with it beforehand. Explore this interactive, easy-to-follow primer on making changes directly to your code, testing out your new skills as you go, and making edits on your own in real time. Get tips from Morten on picking JS apart, building code from scratch, and then extending it, as well as fetching data from APIs to build new JS components that allow you to use your data. By the end of this course, you’ll be ready to get your hands dirty with your own code, no matter your level of experience or professional background.<br><br>The best way to learn a language is to use it in practice. That’s why this course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out the [Using GitHub Codespaces with this course][gcs-video-url] video to learn how to get started.
